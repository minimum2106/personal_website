                    Hi, I'm <span class="bolded">Hong Quan Tran</span>! I graduated from Université Paris Cité and have two years of apprenticeship 
                    experience tackling various Machine Learning challenges and developing ML-driven products. 
                    I'm passionate about problem-solving and exploring how AI can be applied to real-world scenarios.
                    In my last year as a Data Science apprentice, I focused on modern NLP techniques, including 
                    fine-tuning large pre-trained models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Agentic AI, 
                    integrating them into real use cases for my company and its clients. 
                    However, I'm also eager to dive into other AI domains, such as Computer Vision!                
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="color: red;">I'm currently open to new opportunities! </span> 
                    If you have a role where I can learn and grow, feel free to reach out through

                        This competition focuses on enhancing dataset quality by refining data processing and generation techniques 
                        for a fixed YOLOv5 model. Instead of just manually cleaning the raw dataset and applying standard augmentations, 
                        our team took a smarter approach. We developed a method to automatically identify challenging images and 
                        selectively augment them after each training epoch. This strategy significantly improved the model's performance.

                        paper, which investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve unsupervised learning by refining textual embeddings with an LLM-based 
                        evaluator. In this project, I enhanced the authors' approach by developing a custom loss function to replace the 
                        original one and fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize the pipeline.
